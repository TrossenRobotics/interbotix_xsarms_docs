An easy option if you want to prevent your arm from tipping but don't want it secured in any
permanent manner to a surface is to set a diving weight on top of the electronics box at the back
of the arm base.

Diving weights are not included with your kit, but can be bought at sporting goods stores and
Amazon.

`3/4" #8 Rounded Pan Head Wood Screws`_ can permanently affix your arm to a flat surface when run
through the holes on the outer perimeter of the base (marked below). The base is 3/8" thick
acrylic.

You can mount your arm to a desk, or if you would like to have a less permanent solution, you can
attach your arm to a piece of `MDF hardboard`_ easily.

Pem Nuts and Thumb Screws

A set of M6 pem nuts and thumb screws are the best of both worlds: Your arm will be secured to the
surface you install the pem nuts to, and can also be released via the thumbscrews when the need
arises.
