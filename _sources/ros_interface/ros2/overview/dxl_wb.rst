Overview
========

The :doc:`interbotix_xs_driver <xs_driver>` builds on top of the DYNAMIXEL Workbench Toolbox to
more easily control the DYNAMIXEL servos in the arm. In the ROS 2 Interface, this package is
included as a git submodule and cloned into the interbotix_ros_xseries directory on installation.
You can find the original package in the `ROBOTIS-GIT/dynamixel-workbench GitHub repository`_.
