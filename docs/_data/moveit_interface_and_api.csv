robot_model,model type of the Interbotix Arm such as 'wx200' or 'rx150',""""""
robot_name,"name of the robot (typically equal to ``robot_model``, but could be anything)",$(arg robot_model)
base_link_frame,"name of the 'root' link on the arm; typically 'base_link', but can be changed if attaching the arm to a mobile base that already has a 'base_link' frame",base_link'
show_ar_tag,"if true, the AR tag mount is included in the 'robot_description' parameter; if false, it is left out; set to true if using the AR tag mount in your project",false
use_world_frame,"set this to true if you would like to load a 'world' frame to the 'robot_description' parameter which is located exactly at the 'base_link' frame of the robot; if using multiple robots or if you would like to attach the 'base_link' frame of the robot to a different frame, set this to false",true

external_srdf_loc,the file path to the custom srdf.xacro file that you would like to include in the Interbotix robot's srdf.xacro file. Note that this should only contain 'disable collision' tags for collisions between the original Interbotix Arm and other links that are defined in the file specified by ``external_urdf_loc``,""""""
mode_configs,the file path to the 'mode config' YAML file,refer to `xsarm_moveit_interface.launch`_
use_moveit_rviz,"a boolean that if true, displays RViz with the MoveIt plugin; if false, MoveIt runs in a headless state",true
rviz_frame,"defines the fixed frame parameter in RViz. Note that if 'use_world_frame' is False, this parameter should be changed to a frame that exists",world

dof,"the degrees of freedom of the arm; while the majority of the arms have 5 dof, others have 4 or 6 dof",5
world_name,the file path to the Gazebo 'world' file to load (if simulating),refer to `xsarm_moveit_interface.launch`_
use_cpp_interface,launch the custom **moveit_interface** C++ API node,false
moveit_interface_gui,launch a custom GUI to interface with the **moveit_interface** node so that the user can command specific end-effector poses (defined by 'ee_gripper_link'),true
