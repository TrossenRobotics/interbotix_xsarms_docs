Button,Action
START/OPTIONS,move robot arm to its Home pose
SELECT/SHARE,move robot arm to its Sleep pose
R2,rotate the 'waist' joint clockwise
L2,rotate the 'waist' joint counterclockwise
Triangle,increase gripper pressure in 0.125 step increments (max is 1)
X,decrease gripper pressure in 0.125 step increments (min is 0)
O,open gripper
Square,close gripper
D-pad Up,increase the control loop rate in 1 Hz step increments (max of 40)
D-pad Down,decrease the control loop rate in 1 Hz step increments (min of 10)
D-pad Left,coarse' control - sets the control loop rate to a user-preset 'fast' rate
D-pad Right,fine' control - sets the control loop rate to a user-preset 'slow' rate
Right stick Up/Down,increase/decrease pitch of the end-effector
Right stick Left/Right,increase/decrease roll of the end-effector
R3,reverses the Right stick Left/Right control
Left stick Up/Down,move the end-effector (defined at 'ee_gripper_link') vertically in Cartesian space
Left stick Left/Right,move the end-effector (defined at 'ee_gripper_link') horizontally in Cartesian space
L3,reverses the Left stick Left/Right control
R1,"if the arm has 6dof, this moves the end-effector in a negative direction along its own 'y' axis"
L1,"if the arm has 6dof, this moves the end-effector in a positive direction along its own 'y' axis"
PS,"if torqued on, holding for 3 seconds will torque off the robot; if torqued off, tapping the button will torque on the robot"
