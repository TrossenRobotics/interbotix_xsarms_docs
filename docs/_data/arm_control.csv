Argument,Description,Default Value
robot_model,model type of the Interbotix Arm such as 'wx200' or 'rx150',""""""
robot_name,"name of the robot (typically equal to ``robot_model``, but could be anything)","""$(arg robot_model)"""
base_link_frame,"name of the 'root' link on the arm; typically 'base_link', but can be changed if attaching the arm to a mobile base that already has a 'base_link' frame",'base_link'
show_ar_tag,"if true, the AR tag mount is included in the 'robot_description' parameter; if false, it is left out; set to true if using the AR tag mount in your project",false
show_gripper_bar,"if true, the gripper_bar link is included in the 'robot_description' parameter; if false, the gripper_bar and finger links are not loaded to the parameter server. Set to false if you have a custom gripper attachment",true
show_gripper_fingers,"if true, the gripper fingers are included in the 'robot_description' parameter; if false, the gripper finger links are not loaded to the parameter server. Set to false if you have custom gripper fingers",true
use_world_frame,"set this to true if you would like to load a 'world' frame to the 'robot_description' parameter which is located exactly at the 'base_link' frame of the robot; if using multiple robots or if you would like to attach the 'base_link' frame of the robot to a different frame, set this to false",true
external_urdf_loc,the file path to the custom urdf.xacro file that you would like to include in the Interbotix robot's urdf.xacro file,""""""
use_rviz,launches RViz,true
motor_configs,the file path to the 'motor config' YAML file,refer to `xsarm_control.launch`_
mode_configs,the file path to the 'mode config' YAML file,refer to `xsarm_control.launch`_
load_configs,"a boolean that specifies whether or not the initial register values (under the 'motors' heading) in a Motor Config file should be written to the motors; as the values being written are stored in each motor's EEPROM (which means the values are retained even after a power cycle), this can be set to false after the first time using the robot. Setting to false also shortens the node startup time by a few seconds and preserves the life of the EEPROM",true
use_sim,"if true, the Dynamixel simulator node is run; use RViz to visualize the robot's motion; if false, the real Dynamixel driver node is run",false
